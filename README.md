# Token Faucet

## Project Title
Token Faucet

## Project Description
Token Faucet is a Soroban-based smart contract designed to facilitate the distribution of tokens on the Stellar blockchain. The faucet provides a controlled mechanism for users to request tokens with predefined distribution amounts and cooldown periods, making it an ideal solution for testnet environments, educational purposes, and community engagement activities.

The system maintains a record of all distributions, tracks user claims, and allows administrative control over key parameters. This simple yet effective token distribution system ensures fair access to tokens while preventing abuse through configurable cooldown periods between claims.

## Project Vision
The vision for the Token Faucet project is to create an accessible, efficient, and reliable token distribution system that lowers the barrier to entry for blockchain application testing and development on the Stellar network. By providing a straightforward way to obtain tokens, we aim to accelerate adoption, experimentation, and innovation within the Stellar ecosystem.

Our goal is to build a foundational infrastructure component that supports various use cases from developer sandboxes to community airdrops, while ensuring equitable distribution and responsible token management. The faucet serves as both an educational tool for newcomers to understand token mechanics and a practical utility for experienced developers to test their applications with minimal friction.

## Key Features
